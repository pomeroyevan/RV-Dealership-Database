Purpose:
  This database was made to practice and demonstrate database administration skills using Oracle Apex and SQL.
After being given sample documents, i was tasked with making a relational database to store information collected
by ficticious RV dealership in Pismo Beach, CA.

Planning
  I identified no mojor risks and one target audience for my database.  It will be accesses by the stakeholders
of the RV dealership and used for recording customer, employee, and vehicle information

Defining Requirements
  Considering this is a small dealership that does not process much information, Aoracle apex database mangament 
  and application building services will work well for this job

Designing Product Architecture
  Using sales invoice, service invoice, and purchase order documents I created 3 entity relationship diagrams 
and on wholistic enterprise ERD.  With this I also made an attributes list to prepare for table creation

Development
  I split development into 5 main tasks: customers, employees, services, vehicles, sales, data analysis
Each task has the necessary created tables, added entires, and basic data views to check for errors.
The last task consists of many views to be used by management to find and analyse necessary information.

Testing
  Testing was done by addind and removing various entires and viewing reoprts to see necessary changes in data
  
Deployment
  The database was deployed with an accompanying app which allows members of management to see sales invoices,
customer information, and employee information
  
  Reflreciton
    Alltogether this project greatly increased my knowledge and understanding of SQL and relational databases as a whole.
  In the future I would like to work with larger datasets pulled from an existing api into my own database where I can
  then run analysis methods in new data.
